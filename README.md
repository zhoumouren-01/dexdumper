# DexDumper - Memory-based DEX Extraction Library

---

## 📖 Overview

DexDumper is an advanced Android library that performs runtime memory analysis to detect and extract DEX files from within applications. Unlike traditional methods that require root privileges or external tools, DexDumper operates entirely within the application's own process space.

## ✨ Main Features

- **🕵️‍♂️ Non-Root Operation** - Works on standard Android devices without root access
- **🔒 Self-Contained** - Pure C implementation with no external dependencies
- **🎯 Smart Memory Scanning** - Intelligent region filtering and DEX signature detection
- **🛡️ Safe Memory Access** - Signal-handled memory reading prevents crashes
- **📊 Duplicate Prevention** - SHA1 checksum and inode-based duplicate detection

## 💡 Why Choose DexDumper?

### 🚀 Special Advantages

**🔄 Complete Isolation Operation**
DexDumper is specifically designed for non-root devices.
If this library is implemented in a sandbox or virtual machine, it can dump the dex files of official apps without breaking their integrity. The process is simple:

- Implement the library in a sandbox or virtual machine.
- Clone and run the official/test apps inside the sandbox or virtual machine.
- The dex files of the official/test apps will be dumped and saved.

## 🛠️ Build & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android NDK (for native compilation)
- Termux app (for on-device building)

> 💡 Tip:
> If you encounter issues with NDK builds or Termux setup, you can use the GitHub Actions workflow to auto-compile the source — no manual setup needed, handles dependencies, and builds for all architectures.

### Build Instructions

#### Using NDK Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/muhammadrizwan87/dexdumper.git
cd dexdumper

# Set NDK path (adjust according to your setup)
export NDK_HOME=/path/to/your/ndk
# export NDK_HOME=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/android-sdk/ndk/24.0.8215888

# Build for all architectures
$NDK_HOME/ndk-build NDK_PROJECT_PATH=. NDK_APPLICATION_MK=./jni/Application.mk

# Output will be in libs/ directory
ls libs/
# armeabi-v7a/ arm64-v8a/ x86/ x86_64/
```

### Installation & Usage

Ensure that the native library is loaded within the class initializer of the application’s main entry-point class.

#### Option A: Integration in Android App

**1. Add to your project:**
```java
public class MyApp extends Application {
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("dexdumper");
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        // Dumping starts automatically when library loads
    }
}
```

**2. Update build.gradle:**
```gradle
android {
    sourceSets {
        main {
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['libs']
        }
    }
}
```

#### Option B: Patch on Android App

**1. Smali code to load library:**
```smali
.method static constructor <clinit>()V
    .registers 1
    
    const-string v0, "dexdumper"
    
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V

    return-void
.end method
```

**2. Add library in android app:**

- lib/armeabi-v7a/libdexdumper.so
- lib/arm64-v8a/libdexdumper.so
- lib/x86/libdexdumper.so
- lib/x86_64/libdexdumper.so

## 📁 Output Locations

DexDumper will automatically try these directories in order. You can change the order if you want, or add a custom directory.

1. `/data/data/[PACKAGE]/files/dex_dump/` (Primary)
2. `/data/user/0/[PACKAGE]/files/dex_dump/` (Multi-user)
3. `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/[PACKAGE]/files/dex_dump/` (External)
4. `/sdcard/Android/data/[PACKAGE]/files/dex_dump/` (Legacy external)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Build-time Configuration (config.h)

```c
// Enable/disable region filtering
// Effect of disabling: Scans ALL memory regions including system areas
#define ENABLE_REGION_FILTERING 1 // Enabled

// DEX file size limits
#define DEX_MIN_FILE_SIZE 1024
#define DEX_MAX_FILE_SIZE (50 * 1024 * 1024)

// Memory scanning limits  
#define DEFAULT_SCAN_LIMIT (2 * 1024 * 1024)
#define MAX_REGION_SIZE (200 * 1024 * 1024)

// Logging level control
extern int verbose_logging;
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Minimal impact (typically < 10MB)
- **CPU Usage**: Single background thread with yield operations
- **Storage**: Automatic cleanup of output directory
- **Battery**: Short-lived operation with sleep intervals

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

### What DexDumper DOES NOT Do:
- ❌ No network communication
- ❌ No data exfiltration
- ❌ No root escalation attempts
- ❌ No app modification
- ❌ No permanent system changes

### Safety Features:
- ✅ Signal-protected memory access
- ✅ Bounds checking on all operations
- ✅ Safe directory traversal
- ✅ Resource cleanup on completion
- ✅ No persistent background services
